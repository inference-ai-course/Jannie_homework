=== Abstract ===

Abstract:While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16 over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that 1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS.
